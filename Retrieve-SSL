If public keys are not provided by your upstream, you can extract them by yourself using the following command

#openssl s_client -connect httpbin.org:443 -servername httpbin.org 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout

===================================

If you already have a certificate, and just need to get its public key, you can do it using the following command

openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in cert.pem
